# Cryptocurrency Analysis and Reporting Tool

<img src="./images/crypto_panda_trading.png" alt="Crypto Panda Trading" width="50%"/>

This project is a Python-based automated tool for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on cryptocurrency market trends. The script fetches market data, analyzes trends, sentiment, and potential surges using various APIs, and generates a detailed weekly report which is then sent via email.

## Features

- **Market Data Analysis**: Integrates with the CoinPaprika API to fetch and analyze historical cryptocurrency data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool and GPT-4 for analyzing news and social media sentiment.
- **Surge Detection**: Detects potential surges in cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes.
- **Email Reporting**: Automatically generates and sends a detailed HTML report to a specified email address.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements a robust retry mechanism for API calls to handle temporary failures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt`.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set:

- `COIN_PAPRIKA_API_KEY`: API key for accessing CoinPaprika.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for accessing GPT-4 via OpenAI.
- `CRYPTO_NEWS_API_KEY`: API key for fetching cryptocurrency news.
- `EMAIL_FROM`: The sender's email address for sending reports.
- `EMAIL_TO`: The recipient's email address for receiving reports.
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server address for sending emails.
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: SMTP server username.
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP server password.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables as described above.

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python monitor_coins.py
    ```

## Usage

The script is designed to run on a weekly schedule. It fetches and analyzes cryptocurrency data, then generates a report summarizing key trends and insights. The report is automatically sent to the specified email address.

## Configuration

- **TEST_ONLY**: Set to `True` to test the script with a limited set of cryptocurrencies. Set to `False` for full functionality.
- **RESULTS_FILE**: The filename where results will be saved before emailing.
- **HIGH_VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD**: Threshold for considering a cryptocurrency highly volatile.
- **FEAR_GREED_THRESHOLD**: The threshold for the Fear and Greed Index.

## Deployment

A pattern that I have found successful to deploy an EC2 instance (micro) using a CloudFormation script (to instantiate the VPC and subnets and the security groups and IAM roles). Then schedule via EventBridge a signal to kick off the script on the EC2 instance at a regular internal (I have chosen twice a week). The EC2 is set to destruct after 48 hours, with the lambda reviving whenever a run of the script is needed. This keeps the costs reasonable.
